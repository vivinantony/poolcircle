              <p>One of the biggest pain points of attending an event is the driving there and the parking hassles. Event organizers too face challenges of car parking management. We partnered with Explara to ensure that we can offer an integrated experience for the Event Organizer and for the attendee to carpool to the event.</p>

              <p>As an Event Organizer, you can choose to offer carpool options to your attendees by clicking on the "Enable carpool using PoolCircle" option in the Event Setup -> Settings -> Marketplace Settings. Once this is done, every attendee will see the option to carpool to the event along with their invitiation.</p>
              <p>As an attendee, you can register to carpool to the event by clicking on the Carpool to this event link in your invitation email. Tell us where you will come to the event from and where you will go afte the event.</p>
              <p>PoolCircle will start finding other users who are going to the event from your area and users who are going to the same destination after the event, based on the event venue and the event time.</p>
